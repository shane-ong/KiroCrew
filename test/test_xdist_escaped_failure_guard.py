"""A ``Failed`` that escapes the runtest protocol fails one test, not the session.

pytest-timeout's SIGALRM handler calls ``pytest.fail`` from wherever the timer
fires. Inside setup, call or teardown that is an ordinary failure; outside them
-- while pytest renders a report, between phases -- it propagates out of
``pytest_runtest_protocol`` with no report logged, and under xdist the controller
turns that into an INTERNALERROR that erases the whole shard's results. The root
``conftest.py`` wraps the protocol and converts such an escape into a failure
report for the item that owned the timer.

The test drives the exact escape path deterministically with a tiny plugin that
raises ``pytest.fail`` from a hook that runs outside every ``CallInfo``, in a real
xdist session that loads the root conftest as a plugin. Three escape sites prove the
one-report-per-phase rule: ``makereport`` before the call report exists, and
``logreport`` after xdist has sent the call or teardown report. The skipped bystander
proves every collected item still produces a pytest-split durations key, which the CI
count gate requires.

The subprocess test proves reporting end to end. Deterministic unit tests drive the
real root ``pytest_runtest_protocol`` generator with an injected clock and ``CallInfo``
values to pin duration accounting without depending on machine speed.
