"""``spawn_run`` tells the caller when a spawn WAITS instead of claiming it started.

The gateway defers a spawn the memory guard (or a paused adaptive cap) will not
admit yet: the row stays queued and is re-checked every admit wait, possibly for
hours on a host that never clears the floor. ``POST /api/spawn`` answers such a
row with ``status: "queued"`` plus the gate's own reason, and the tool relays it
as ``Queued …`` -- the agent that read ``Spawned 1 subagent(s)`` waited for a
completion event that was never coming.

An answer without ``status`` (an older gateway) or with ``status: "spawned"`` (a
row waiting only for a stagger tick behind the cap) keeps the existing text.
