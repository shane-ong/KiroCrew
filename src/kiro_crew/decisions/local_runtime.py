"""Run a local decision model for the gateway: fetch it, install it, serve it.

A local preset (:mod:`.local_models`) names everything the gateway needs to run
the model itself, so the owner never installs or starts anything by hand:

1. **Weights.** Each pinned file is fetched from Kiro Crew's model CDN through
   :func:`kiro_crew.asset_downloader.download_to`, which installs nothing until
   the streamed sha256 matches the pin. A receipt beside the files records which
   pins are already verified, so a restart does not rehash 8 GB.
2. **Environment.** A uv-managed Python 3.12 virtualenv per preset, built from
   the exact-pin lock shipped in ``local_servers/``. On Linux torch comes from the
   PyTorch CPU index, which keeps the environment near 1 GB instead of pulling the
   CUDA build. uv runs under the shared sandbox with a scrubbed environment: it
   executes third-party build code and is not entitled to the gateway's
   credentials.
3. **Server.** The preset's launcher runs in that environment, bound to
   127.0.0.1 on the port the provider route chose, sandboxed and in a cgroup
   scope. It is ready when ``GET /kirocrew-attest`` answers with the secret this
   launch handed it: any program can bind the port while the weights load, and
   only the server this runtime started knows that secret.

One preset runs at a time: :meth:`LocalModelRuntime.activate` replaces whatever
was wanted before, :meth:`deactivate` stops it. A server that exits on its own is
restarted with a growing delay; after :data:`MAX_FAILURES` consecutive failures
the runtime stops trying and reports the error with the tail of the server log,
because a model that cannot start (no memory, a broken download) will not start
on the next attempt either.

Everything blocking runs on one worker thread per activation, and a worker holds
its preset's writer lock for as long as it touches that preset's files, so a
replacement worker for the same preset waits for the old one, and :meth:`remove`
refuses a preset a worker still holds. :meth:`deactivate` stops a child process,
so it, like the rest of the control surface, is called off the event loop.
