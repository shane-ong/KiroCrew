"""``decide`` -- the one function a point calls, and every refusal in front of it.

Four refusals, cheapest first, each returning ``None``: the keystone
``decisions_consent.json`` does not consent for the configured provider endpoint
(``decisions.consent.permits``); *point* is not in :data:`DECISION_POINT_NAMES`;
the session hashes outside ``decisions.bucket``; the state or a question carries a
credential or an exfiltration-shaped URL. Then the call itself, which returns
``None`` on a timeout, a provider failure, or an answer outside the declared domain.

The first three write nothing at all, which is what makes "no consent leaves the
log directory empty" checkable. The scrub and the call failures write one row,
because a silent scrub is the worst outcome available: the operator would read a
missing row as "not firing" when the seam fires and refuses every time.

Two properties the order is chosen for. Consent is the first thing checked and the
keystone read is the only await before the refusal, so a seam without consent is
provably inert rather than merely fast (pinned by
``test_decisions_gate.TestDisabledPerformsNoAwait``). And the scrub sits BEFORE
the network, so no transport can exist above it.

Config comes from the live watcher's snapshot, read ONCE per call, never from
disk; consent comes from the keystone, never from ``config.json`` (that file is
agent-writable, so it carries no ``enabled`` at all). Anything unreadable -- no
snapshot, no section, a keystone that is absent, corrupt or not a literal
``true`` for this endpoint, a bucket that is not a number, an attribute read that
raises -- resolves to OFF: fail-closed is the only safe direction for a gate whose
open state sends conversation text to a third party.

Two budgets, both named here so a caller can size its own outer wait: the provider
call is bounded by :func:`timeout_secs`, and the row write by
:data:`_LOG_BUDGET_SECS` plus, only after an overrun, the bounded
:data:`_LOG_COMMIT_GRACE_SECS`. Nothing this module logs carries a provider message
or a traceback -- a row's ``error`` is one of the identifiers below and the application
log gets the exception CLASS only, because both artifacts are readable and a provider
can quote the request back.

#: selection below is keyed on it; the point's own module, which the core wake-judge
#: change adds beside the six in ``decisions/points/``,

#: answered.
JUDGE_POINT = "nudge.wake"

#: The two lanes. ``jev`` is the shipped ``JevOracle`` over HTTP; ``llm`` is
#: ``impl_llm.LlmOracle`` over one tool-less model call on the session's own
#: provider. ``decisions.nudge_wake.provider`` also accepts ``auto``, which resolves to
#: one of these two at decision time rather than being a third lane.
LANE_JEV = "jev"
LANE_LLM = "llm"

#: The LLM lane's budget floor and ceiling, in seconds. The seam's own
#: ``provider.timeout_ms`` is sized for Jev (1 s by default, ~100 ms in practice)
#: and a text model cannot answer inside it, so a lane that honoured that number
#: alone would time out on every tick and fall back forever -- the feature would
#: read as "does nothing" rather than as "misconfigured". The configured value is
#: therefore CLAMPED UP into this window rather than replaced, so an operator who

#: and a skill description is text this build shipped, while a recalled memory is
#: text the AGENT wrote down turns or days ago about work the owner was not
#: reviewing when they consented. An install that granted either other scope is
#: inert here.

#: scope (``consent.consented_nudge_evidence``). A FOURTH set rather than a wider
#: reading of ``compaction``, because the two were reviewed as different things:

    There is no feature toggle, and the two lanes are authorized by different things,
    because they send to different places:

    * The Jev lane sends conversation state to a paid third party, so it needs the
      keystone in full -- consent for the configured endpoint AND the point's own
      ``nudge_evidence`` scope, which is what that scope MEANS: a category of THAT
      egress. ``jev_consented`` is the endpoint read, already taken by the caller
      off the event loop, and it already folds the fleet ceiling in; the scope is
      read here, fail-closed, through :func:`_point_scope_granted`.
    * The LLM lane adds no destination. Its state goes to the model provider the
      owner's sessions already send to every turn, and the evidence is the owner's
      own children's transcripts, which that provider already received when those
      sessions ran. The judge only chooses QUIET against firing and is fail-open, so
      the worst case is one delayed wake, bounded by the quiet-streak floor, and it
      spends less than the ticks it removes. So
      ``decisions.nudge_wake.provider = llm`` plus a ``judge`` spec on the loop is
      the whole authorization: no keystone involvement, no second consent row
      (RFC ``rfc-wake-judge``, Providers).

    ``auto`` resolves against the Jev side ARMED rather than merely consented, so an
    owner who consented to the endpoint but never granted this point's scope gets the
    small model instead of a refusal. An explicitly pinned ``jev`` still refuses:
    they named a lane, and quietly answering from a different one would be worse.

    The FLEET ceiling still binds both. A managed install that pinned
    ``capabilities.decisions`` off has withdrawn the seam, not merely one provider's
    endpoint, and a lane that ran under that pin would be the seam running anyway.
    So the LLM lane pays the governed probe itself, which the Jev lane gets for free
    inside ``_consented_for``.

    Fail-closed on anything unreadable: ``(LANE_JEV, False)`` refuses, and a refusal
    here is a tick that fires exactly as the ungated timer would. A build with no
    scope registered for the point closes the JEV lane only; ``auto`` then lands on
    the LLM lane, which that scope does not govern.
