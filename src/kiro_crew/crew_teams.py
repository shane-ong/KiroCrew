"""Crewmate teams: ``$KIROCREW_HOME/crew-teams/teams.json``.

Named ``crew_teams`` because ``kiro_crew.teams`` is the Microsoft Teams channel
package; a same-named module would be shadowed by it.

A team is a name plus an ordered list of crewmates (exact crew names). It is
the manager's grouping of the roster, nothing more: no memory, no chat, no
prompt of its own. The Crewmates page groups the roster by team and opens a
team view for each; everything in that view is derived from the members'
existing threads, activity and presence.

Every mutation runs read -> mutate -> rewrite under TWO locks: a process-wide
``threading.Lock`` (``_WRITE_LOCK``) and, inside it, an advisory file lock on
``crew-teams/.lock`` (``platform_compat.file_lock``). The gateway's writers (the
owner routes, the crew create/delete/package-sync hooks) run off-loop in worker
threads; ``kirocrew agent create`` / ``delete`` write from ANOTHER process. Two
interleaved rewrites of one document would otherwise have the second silently
drop the first's change, and only the file lock reaches the CLI. Writers hold
the lock for a sub-second read plus an atomic rename, so the default ceiling
applies; a contended acquire past it fails closed (``OSError``, answered as
``teams_write_failed``) rather than writing unserialized.

Two invariants the store enforces so no UI has to:

* **A crewmate is on at most one team.** Assigning a crewmate to a team removes
  it from whichever team held it, in the same write, so two readers can never
  see it in two groups.
* **The file is one document.** Every mutation rewrites the whole list
  atomically (unique temp file + rename), so a torn record is never observable.

The file lives in its own data-home directory, ``crew-teams/``, and NOT under
``trust/``: ``trust`` is a declared sandbox READ-WRITE exception (in-sandbox code
appends to the audit log there), so a record under it stays writable by a
sandboxed command that builds the path at runtime -- the ``crew-panels`` lesson
in ``sandbox.py``. ``crew-teams`` is instead masked from every sandboxed process
(``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES``, pre-created before each spawn so the mask is
never vacuous) and fenced from agent file tools (``security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``).
Two trusted writers open it, both owner-invoked: the gateway on a dashboard
action (the ``/api/teams`` routes, the crew create, delete and package-sync
hooks) and ``kirocrew agent create`` / ``delete`` from the operator's shell. A crewmate's
own tools therefore cannot re-team itself or its siblings, and the team view is
a human surface built on human choices.

Member NAMES, not slugs, are stored: slugification is lossy (two names can
share one slug), and the roster is keyed and selected by exact name.
