/**
 * One decision point's own settings — the DETAIL half of the Decisions (Jev) card.
 *
 * Split into its own module so the CARD can be mounted synchronously while this is
 * loaded on demand. Both halves of that matter and they pull in opposite directions:
 *
 *  - the card must be synchronous, because settings search highlights a control by
 *    probing the DOM for it and gives up after 100 ms. A deep link to
 *    `developer.decisions-jev` that arrived while a chunk was still in flight found
 *    nothing and rang no control.
 *  - this panel need not be, because nothing it draws is in the settings registry:
 *    every control here takes its label from a map keyed by the SERVER's id (the
 *    scope, the tier), which is what lets a gateway ship another point with no edit
 *    on this side — and is exactly why the extractor cannot index them.
 *
 * So the registry-indexed controls stay eager and the rest rides a boundary. There is
 * no state of its own here: the panel is a pure function of the row and the view, and
 * the card remounts it per point (`key={shown}`) so one point's draft or open
 * disclosure cannot decide the next one's.
